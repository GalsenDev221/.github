We are Building the largest community of Senegalese developers 🇸🇳 🚀

**Galsen DEV** is a community that brings together Senegalese developers with the aim of creating an ecosystem conducive to creation and sharing as a developer and popularizing programming throughout Senegal. We also set ourselves the goal of helping beginners and people wishing to join the field of programming.
